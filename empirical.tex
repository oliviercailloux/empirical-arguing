\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
It is clear (?) that arguments that are not attacked are of prominent importance for society. Talk about obtaining judgements of individuals, …

Correspondingly, arguments that are not attacked are of prominent importance in many (otherwise different) formal approaches about argumentation. 

Note that “not attacked” depends on which set of arguments we look into; we consider for this discussion that the set of arguments encompasses every arguments that are possibly relevant to the topic at hand (and will come back to this). In this context, we call decisive the non-attacked arguments. 

NB in some examples, some arguments are left unattacked (for example, the gvt is not expected to answer every counter-argument). Also, in preference-based argumentation, arguments can be “unattacked subjectively”: specific preferences of an individual may invalidate an argument and leave only another argument as decisive.

\section{The usual perspective (in FAT?) about attacks}
Usually considered known a priori: logical representation; or simply given

\section{Reasons not to consider it known}
What counts is sometimes (at least in part) what the receiver understands, not what logic says; there may be implicit information not encoded in the logic representation; we may not have expertise to encode the arguments logically; encoding may be suspected to be non neutral wrt the debated issue

\section{what if not known a priori?}
We consider that what counts is what the receiver of the argument says and we propose to study several aspects related to this perspective: how to find decisive arguments in this sense; is this consensual; what are appropriate methods, statistical or others; what are the protocols that must be used to gather arguments; how can we test that every arguments that are possibly relevant have been considered?

\section{a sketch of a possible approach}
Let people come to a website and argue and indicate which arguments theirs answer, then confront this to the opinion of other visitors

\section{Others}
We should decide whether to include some of these points in the text or adding sections about them or dropping them.
\begin{itemize}
	\item possibly, contrast with persuasion?
	\item link to explainable AI (should focus on decisive arguments), exploitation of weaknesses of will or sub-conscious behavioral patterns (youtube autoplay; nudge; anchoring) VS reflective arguments (advocacy), and the like? Link to deliberative democracy?
	\item review existing experimental work in FAT? Other related works? Philosophical approaches (Rawls, Habermas)?
\end{itemize}
